K&R C 2.7:

- in assignment, value on right is converted to type of the value at left;
- in function call, actual arguments are converted to formal parameter type of the function;
- in other binary operators which take multiple operands of different types,
  like *, /, %, +, -, the narrower operand is promoted to the type of
  the wider operand without losing information.

  When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted
  to a common type according to a small number of rules. In general,
  the only automatic conversions are those that convert a "narrower" operand
  into a "wider" one without losing information.

  Implicit arithmetic conversions work .much as expected.
  In general, if an operator like + or * that takes two operands (a
  binary operator) has operands of different types, the "lower" type is
  promoted to the "higher" type before the operation proceeds.
  The result is of the higher type.

// c++ primer 5th, 4.11.1:

promoted to int if all possible values of that type fit in an int.

https://c-faq.com/expr/confused.html, 3.11,

If an object (as defined above) appears more than once in an expression,
and is the object modified in the expression, make sure that all
appearances of the object which fetch its value participate in the
computation of the new value which is stored.
This rule allows the expression:

i = i + 1 ; // only fetch its value on the right side, then assign it.
// i = i++; // error, increment its value on the right side, then assign it.

because although the object i appears twice and is modified,
the appearance (on the right-hand side) which fetches i's old value
is used to compute i's new value.


---


https://c-faq.com/expr/evalorder1.html, 3.1:

The subexpression i++ causes a side effect--it modifies i's value--which leads
to undefined behavior since i is also referenced elsewhere in the same
expression. There is no way of knowing whether the reference will happen before
or after the side effect--in fact, neither obvious interpretation might hold;

a[i] = i++; // error
i + (i = 1); // error?

// rule of zero

Aggregates in C++17 are defined as classes (including structs) that:
Have no user-declared constructors.
Have no private or protected non-static data members.
Have no base classes.
Have no virtual member functions.

the presence of the std::string member disqualifies S from being
an aggregate under C++17 rules.
When you try to use emplace_back("abc", 123) in C++17,
the compiler looks for a matching constructor in S that takes two parameters,
but since you haven't explicitly defined such a constructor,
it results in a compilation error.

C++20 and Later

In C++20, the rules for aggregate initialization were relaxed.
a class contains members with default constructors (like std::string),
it can still be considered an aggregate, provided that the other conditions
(no private members, no user-declared constructors, etc.) are met.

This means that in C++20, S can be aggregate-initialized directly
using the two provided arguments ("abc" and 123) for its members name and num.
The compiler can now generate the appropriate initialization without requiring
an explicit constructor.
So in C++20 and later, this code works:

v.emplace_back("abc", 123);

The compiler can treat this as aggregate initialization,
directly constructing an S object by passing the arguments to
the name (std::string) and num (int) members.

// c++ primer 5th, 7.5.5:
We can initialize the data members of an aggregate class
by providing a braced list of member initializers:

  // val1.ival=0;val1.s=string("Anna")
  Data val1 = { 0, "Anna" };

Under C's integral promotion rules, the multiplication is carried out
using int arithmetic, and the result may overflow or be truncated before
being promoted and assigned to the long int left-hand side.
Use an explicit cast on at least one of the operands to force long arithmetic:

int a = INT_MAX;
int b = INT_MAX; // or, long b = INT_MAX;
long int c = (long int)a * b; // ok, explicit type conversion on operand
long int d = ((long int)a) * b; // ok, explicit type conversion on operand
long int e = (1L * a) * b;

https://c-faq.com/misc/sd26.html,

How can I ensure that integer arithmetic doesn't overflow?

The usual approach is to test the operands against the limits in the
header file <limits.h> before doing the operation. For example,
here is a ``careful'' addition function:

int chkadd(int a, int b) {
  if(INT_MAX - b < a) {
    fputs("int overflow\n", stderr);
    return INT_MAX;
  }
  return a + b;
}

Here is a complete set of three functions for ``careful''
addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
(Note: these functions are still not perfect, and may fail if invoked on
various edge cases, such as the smallest negative integer, INT_MIN.)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int chkadd(int a, int b) {
  if(b < 0)
    return chksub(a, -b);
  if(INT_MAX - b < a) {
    fputs("int overflow\n", stderr);
    return INT_MAX;
  }
  return a + b;
}

int chksub(int a, int b) {
  if(b < 0)
    return chkadd(a, -b);
  if(INT_MIN + b > a) {
    fputs("int underflow\n", stderr);
    return INT_MIN;
  }
  return a - b;
}

int chkmul(int a, int b) {
  int sign = 1;
  if(a == 0 || b == 0) return 0;
  if(a < 0) { a = -a; sign = -sign; }
  if(b < 0) { b = -b; sign = -sign; }
  if(INT_MAX / b < a) {
    fputs("int overflow\n", stderr);
    return (sign > 0) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
  }
  return sign * a * b;
}

// https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion ,

prvalues of small integral types (such as char) may be converted to
prvalues of larger integral types (such as int).

In particular, arithmetic operators do not accept types smaller
than int as arguments, and integral promotions are automatically applied
after lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, if applicable.


// K&R C 2nd:

2.3 Constants:
An integer constant like 1234 is an int.
A long constant is written with a terminal 1 (ell) or L, as in 123456789L;
an integer too big to fit into an int will also be taken as a long.
Unsigned constants are written with a terminal u or U,
and the suffix ul or UL indicates unsigned long.

2.7 Type Conversions:
Otherwise, convert char and short to int.

A.6.1 Integral Promotion:
A character, a short integer, ..is converted to int;

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/lifetime ,

Temporary lifetime
Struct and union objects with array members (either direct or members of
nested struct/union members) that are designated by non-lvalue expressions,
have temporary lifetime. Temporary lifetime begins when the expression
that refers to such object is evaluated and ends at
the next sequence point (until C11)
when the containing full expression or full declarator ends (since C11).

Any attempt to modify an object with temporary lifetime results in undefined behavior.

struct T { double a[4]; };
struct T f(void) { return (struct T){3.15}; }
double g1(double* x) { return *x; }
void g2(double* x) { *x = 1.0; }

int main(void) {
  double d = g1(f().a); // C99: UB access to a[0] in g1 whose lifetime ended
                        //      at the sequence point at the start of g1
                        // C11: OK, d is 3.15
  g2(f().a); // C99: UB modification of a[0] whose lifetime ended at the sequence point
             // C11: UB attempt to modify a temporary object
}

// Sequence point occurs:

$ 7.12.1, C A reference manual, 5th
- at the end of a full expression--that is,
  an initializer, an expression statement, the expression in a return
  statement, and the control expressions in a conditional, iterative,
  or switch statement (including each expression in a for statement)
- after the first operand of a &&, ||, ?:, or comma operator
- after the evaluation of the arguments and function expression in a
  function call

https://c-faq.com/expr/seqpoints.html, 3.8,

Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its
stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the
value to be stored.

- full expression or expression statement has sequence point at its end,
  subexpresion has sequence point only there is  &&  ||  :?  ,  in it.

- a variable can be modified only once within one single sequence point.

- expressions like i = i + 1 which use and modify i but only modify it later
when it's reasonably easy to ensure that the final store of the final value
(into i, in this case) doesn't interfere with the earlier accesses.

  i = i++;    // error, increment its value on the right side, then assign it.
  i++ * i++;  // error

i = i + 1 ; // only fetch its value on the right side, then assign it.
// i = i++; // error, increment its value on the right side, then assign it.

because although the object i appears twice and is modified,
the appearance (on the right-hand side) which fetches i's old value
is used to compute i's new value.

i + (i = 1); // error ?

notes:

1. delegating constructor:

  rule_of_five(rule_of_five&& other) noexcept // move constructor
    : cstring(std::exchange(other.cstring, nullptr)) {}

2. inside the copy assignment,
   the move assignment is called on the temporary object:

  rule_of_five& operator=(const rule_of_five& other) { // copy assignment
    return *this = rule_of_five(other);
  }

3. copy and swap:
  pass arguments by value to function,
  for the single value parameter, copy or move constructor is called.
  it will call copy or move constructor instead of assignment operator.
  assignment operator is for assigning a value to an existing variable.
  constructor is for creating a new parameter object.

  c++ primer 5th, 13.3: copy and swap.
  c++ primer 5th, 13.1.1: parameters that have a nonreference type are copy initialized.

  rule_of_five& operator=(rule_of_five other);

  rule_of_five t1, t2;
  t2 = t1;
  t2 = std::move(t1);

and static_assert can not be used on the call to consecutive_values,

assert from the cassert will be ignored when NDEBUG is defined.
static_assert can not be ignored, and it works at compile time when writing the program.
static_assert evaluates expression at compile-time.

value qualified with keyword const does not meet the requirement of compile time evaluation.
value qualified with keyword constexpr, consteval do meet the requirement of compile time evaluation.


---


const:
Indicates that a variable's value cannot be modified after its initialization.
it means it is a read-only value.
it is not compile-time constant value;

constexpr:
When applied to variables,
it means the variable is constant and must be initialized with a constant expression.
When applied to functions,
it means that the function can be evaluated at compile time if given constant expressions as arguments.

consteval:
indicates that a function is a compile-time function and
must always produce a compile-time constant when called.

constinit:
Guarantees that a variable is initialized at compile time
but does not enforce that it is immutable.
It can be modified after initialization, unlike const.
unlike constexpr, it does not require the variable to be truly constant throughout its lifetime.

K&R C 2.7:

- in assignment, value on right is converted to type of the value at left;
- in function call, actual arguments are converted to formal parameter type of the function;
- in other binary operators which take multiple operands of different types,
  like *, /, %, +, -, the narrower operand is promoted to the type of
  the wider operand without losing information.

  When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted
  to a common type according to a small number of rules. In general,
  the only automatic conversions are those that convert a "narrower" operand
  into a "wider" one without losing information.

  Implicit arithmetic conversions work .much as expected.
  In general, if an operator like + or * that takes two operands (a
  binary operator) has operands of different types, the "lower" type is
  promoted to the "higher" type before the operation proceeds.
  The result is of the higher type.

- all integral smaller than int are converted to int before arithmetic operation takes place;

K&R C, A.6.1 Integral Promotion:

- A character, a short integer, ..is converted to int;

  (then long int, long long int, they are all int)

K&R C 4.1:

- in function return, return value is converted to return type of the function;


https://c-faq.com/expr/intoverflow1.html, 3.14,

arithmetic operation is performed under using int arithmetic,
explicitly convert individual operand larger than int to larger type.

  long int c = (long int)(a * b); // error, conversion, it happens too late

  int powSqrt = pow(sqrtMax, 2); // 2147395600;
  long int longMax = LONG_MAX;   // 9223372036854775807;

  // operands a and b are both valid int,

when it comes to unicode:
be specific about size, use std::u8string, char8_t instead of std::string, char;
be certain about the file encoding before parse it, utf-8, chinese gbk, etc.;

UTF-8:
1 to 4 bytes;
Memory-efficient, compatible with ASCII;
Variable-length encoding can complicate indexing;
Web content, network protocols, general text storage

UTF-16:
2 or 4 bytes;
Efficient for BMP characters, especially for East Asian scripts;
Variable-length encoding, not backward compatible with ASCII;
Applications working with East Asian scripts, Windows systems;

UTF-32:
Always 4 bytes;
Fixed length makes indexing easy;
Inefficient use of memory;
Situations where constant-time access is needed, specialized processing systems;

both compile and link should be with address sanitizer:
$ make -C src/main
c++ -fsanitize=address -Wall -Wextra -std=c++2a -g  -MMD -MP  -c -o main.o main.cpp
c++  -fsanitize=address   main.o   -o main
$

run the program built with address sanitizer on command line directly;
do not run executable built with address sanitizer in gdb debugger;

check address sanitizer:
$ src/main/main

check memory leak with address sanitizer:
$ LSAN_OPTIONS=verbosity=1:log_threads=1 src/main/main
